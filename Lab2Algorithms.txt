Task 1. Straight-line distance between two points

	Step 1. Prompt the user for the x and y coordinates 
			for each point.
			
	Step 2. Collect user input and store each coordinate
			in its own variable.
			
	Step 3. Use Pythagorean theorem to find straight-line
			distance between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). 
			Recall: a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
			
			i. 	a is the difference between x2 and x1
				b is the diffrence between y2 and y1
				
			ii.	c is the square root of the sum of a^2 and b^2.
	
	Step 4.	Display the result of step 3.ii to the user.
	
	

Task 2. Average of four test scores

	Step 1. Prompt the user to input the four test scores.
	
	Step 2. Collect user input and store each test score 
			in its own variable.
	
	Step 3.	Compute the average of the four test scores.
	
			i. 	Compute the sum of the four test scores.
			
			ii.	Divide the sum by the total number of
				test scores (in this case, 4).
					
	Step 4.	Display the result of step 3.ii to the user.
	
	

Task 3. Number of cartons needed, total production cost, and total profit

	Step 1.	Store constants (cost per liter = $0.38, profit per carton = $0.27, 
			and carton capacity = 3.78 liters) given in prompt in final variables.
	
	Step 2.	Prompt the user to input the amount of milk produced in liters.
	
	Step 3. Collect user input and store the value in a variable.
	
	Step 4.	Compute number of cartons needed. Cartons must be stored as an integer.
			i. 	Cartons needed is equal to the amount of milk produced in liters 
				divided by the carton capacity (given), rounded up to the nearest 
				integer.
	
	Step 5.	Compute the total cost of production.
			i.	Total cost of production is equal to the amount of milk produced
				in liters multiplied by the cost per liter (given).
				
	Step 6.	Compute total profit
			i.	Total profit is equal to the number of cartons needed (computed) 
				multiplied by the profit per carton (given).
			
	Step 7. Display the results of step 4.i, 5.i, and 6.i to the user.
